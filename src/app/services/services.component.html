        <h2 class="services-service-title">One on one ThetaHealing®</h2>
        <p class="services-service-p">ThetaHealing® fits into the mind/body therapies as a complementary or alternative health modality. Both therapeutic and self-help, it aims to assist with physical, spiritual and emotional well-being. ThetaHealing® practitioners enter a theta brainwave state in a matter of seconds. <br><br>Because it creates a close connection with the creative source of the universe and a powerful ability to work with the subconscious, ThetaHealing® practitioners are able to connect with this energy and manifest dramatic physical and emotional changes in their clients, promoting healing at the core quantum level of their being. It is in this theta brainwave state that beliefs are changed and downloaded into the person.</p>

      <div id="reiki" class="services-service">
        <h2 class="services-service-title">One on one Reiki</h2>
        <p class="services-service-p">Reiki is a Japanese technique for stress reduction and relaxation that also promotes healing. It is administered by "laying on hands" and is based on the idea that an unseen "life force energy" flows through us and is what causes us to be alive. <br><br>The great value of Reiki is that because it is guided by the Higher Intelligence, it knows exactly where to go and how to respond to restrictions in the flow of Ki. It can work directly in the unconscious parts of the mind/body which contain negative Ki-inhibiting thoughts and feelings and eliminate them. As Reiki flows through a sick or unhealthy area, it breaks up and washes away any negative thoughts or feelings lodged in the unconscious mind/body thus allowing a normal healthy flow of Ki to resume. As this happens, the unhealthy physical organs and tissues become properly nourished with Ki and begin functioning in a balanced healthy way thus replacing illness with health.</p>
